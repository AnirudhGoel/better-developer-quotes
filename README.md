# "How do I become a better developer?"
I've met some amazing developers through React Native Community, and I decided to ask them, "How do I become a better developer?"

This is a compilations of answers I received from them. Some of these quotes are not limited to answers from that specific question.
 
##Q&A

###Brent Vatne
<small>Brent is Front-end web/mobile developer working on Exponent and React Native. He contributes to tons of open-source projects.

Q: <b>I really want to become a better developer; what would you say the first step is?</b>

A: <i>Do stuff you're excited about and contribute to open source projects :-D</i>

Q: <b>How old are you and how much experience do you have as a programmer?</b>

A: <i>I am 30 years old, and very much :o</i>

Q: <b>How did you join Exponent? What was the cause?</b>

A: <i>James (ide) and I were the most active contributors to react-native outside of facebook and so we spoke a lot. He created exponent with Charlie.
      I ended up doing some consulting work with them and Charlie asked if I'd be interested in working with them full time and yea, it was lots of fun so I joined.</i>
      
Q: <b>I should know objective C and Java thoroughly before I jump in to React Native, right?</b>

A: <i>You can learn it as you go if you need to. there's also tons of pure javascript stuff that needs to be done. and documentation. lots of things :)</i>

###Charlie Cheever
<small>Charlie Cheever is the co-founder of Quora, an online knowledge market. He was formerly an engineer and manager at Facebook, where he oversaw the creation of Facebook Connect and the Facebook Platform. Prior to Facebook, Cheever was employed by Amazon.com in Seattle. He left Facebook to start Quora in June 2009 to work on Exponent.

Q: <b>What's the motivation of Exponent being free and Open Source?</b>

A: <i>I really want to make something that like a 12 year old version of me would use. So, someone who doesn't know tons about programming but can learn new things and doesn't have a credit card or lots of money, but has time and creativity and a phone and friends.
I learned to program making calculator games on TI-85, it's sad to me that kids cant make stuff on their phones today.</i>

Q: <b>Why did you leave Quora?</b>

A: <i>I managed the mobile teams there and it was so slow to work on those apps even tho we had good people, I found it so frustrating
      And after I left I tried to build some mobile stuff and it was so annoying that I decided there needed to be a different way to make stuff.
      So James and I made something like react Native called Ion. It was strikingly similar actually. But React Native already had android support and 20 people working on it, and we had 2 people.
      So we decided to make everything else around it that we wanted to make!</i>
      
Q: <b>What did you do at Facebook?</b>
      
A: <i>I made the developer platform that all those games like FarmVille were on. Well not all of it obviously but was one of two main developers. And I worked on the first version of facebook video, then did a lot of random other things.
Then was a manager and did login with Facebook on other sites, and then left to do Quora.</i>

###Janic Duplessis

<small>Janic is the co-founder of App & Flow, a react-native contributor and open-source contributor.

Q: <b>Any tips to becoming a better developer?</b>

A: <i>Don't think there's anything in particular, you just have keep learning and getting out of your comfort zone.
Like trying a new language or framework from time to time. At least that's what I do but I'm pretty sure there are some other good ways haha :-)</i>

Q: <b>How can I start contributing to React Native?</b>

A: <i>The best is to start with something small like a bug fix or adding a small feature like an extra prop on a component. 
Most contributors know either iOS or Android and a bit of JS. There are also some JS devs that work on things like the packager and cli.
We keep some issues with a Good First Task label that should be a good place to start</i>

###Jake Murzy

<small>Jake is an Open-source Archaeologist. He writes buzzword compliant code. Co-founder at @commitocracy.

Q: <b>Hey Jake, any tips to becoming a better programmer? :-)</b>

A: <i>Number one thing you should do is to learn your tools before you learn the language you work in, because it will lead to faster feedback loops and you will get to experience more in less time. So install a linter and it will catch most of your errors as you type.
It statically analyzes your code and recommends best practices to follow. You should always follow best practices until you gain enough experience to start questioning them.</i>

Q: <b>How do you become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>Hmm... Becoming a good developer... Every developer has his or her own personality when it comes to programming.
As an analogy, think about blacksmiths! Not all blacksmiths are alike--some enjoy crafting the best sword, while some might enjoy testing out the sword more than crafting it.
I am a thinker--who plans and organizes thoughts before I carry out an action. I think a good developer knows how to write concise and clean code; you should practice this habit.
Even though the trend for programming is always changing, and many people use different languages, write a piece of code that anyone can understand without comments.</i>
 
Q: <b>What do you think is the next BIG thing? </b>

A: <i>I've observed the evolution of programming languages, and I think it's becoming more abstract every generation--procedural programming, imperative programming, functional programming...
I think in the future, maybe in about 20 to 30 years, we will live in the time where the computer writes the code for us, and we just put them together like legos.</i>

Q: <b>What should I focus on studying?</b>

A: <i>I think deep learning is a must. Try different tutorials and learn it with passion. Math, algorithms--anything will help you in the long run.
