Q: <b>Any tips to becoming a better developer?</b>

A: <i>Don't think there's anything in particular, you just have keep learning and getting out of your comfort zone.
Like trying a new language or framework from time to time. At least that's what I do but I'm pretty sure there are some other good ways haha :-)</i>

Q: <b>How can I start contributing to React Native?</b>

A: <i>The best is to start with something small like a bug fix or adding a small feature like an extra prop on a component. 
Most contributors know either iOS or Android and a bit of JS. There are also some JS devs that work on things like the packager and cli.
We keep some issues with a Good First Task label that should be a good place to start</i>

Q: <b>Hey Jake, any tips to becoming a better programmer? :-)</b>

A: <i>Number one thing you should do is to learn your tools before you learn the language you work in, because it will lead to faster feedback loops and you will get to experience more in less time. So install a linter and it will catch most of your errors as you type.
It statically analyzes your code and recommends best practices to follow. You should always follow best practices until you gain enough experience to start questioning them.</i>
