Q: <b>How do you think I can become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
Obviously, never stay complacent with what you know - this field changes ridiculously fast, and you need to keep up with it. Follow along with the news in the tech industry, perhaps read up on some source code for a Python module that you recently used.

A friend of mine had some free time over winter break, so he decided to teach himself Django and build a webapp that he could interact with over SMS. It's sort of a toy project, but he really enjoyed learning the different development paradigms. For context, he specializes in embedded systems and robotics, so this is nowhere near his comfort zone.

But pushing yourself to try different things will make you much stronger as an engineer. I personally wish I had done more web stuff before this year - in my organization (PiE), we're developing a new iteration of a robotics kit to be used by highschool students. While I have a good grasp of the low-level and systems stuff, I'm at a loss when it comes managing our UI design.
Never had an interest in doing that type of stuff full-time, but having even a surface-level knowledge can be immensely helpful
</i>

Q: <b>Do you have any projects you did to push yourself out of your comfort zone?</b>

A: <i>
I built an automated door opener last summer, which operated a mechanical lever to open a door when an RFID card was scanned.
The project used a really powerful motor and a mess of sensors to track the state of the arm, which proved to be quite difficult to coordinate.
I learned real quick that I would need to do a bunch of offline testing before running my code on the device, which was very different from what I was used to up till then.

In terms of academics, I just finished CS 189, which was a massive crash course in data science, optimization, and probability theory. The programming I did in that class was also very different from what I'm used to, even though it was all in Python.

<a name="brent"></a>
###Brent Vatne
<small>Brent is Front-end web/mobile developer working on Exponent and React Native. He contributes to tons of open-source projects.
                
https://github.com/brentvatne</small>

Q: <b>I really want to become a better developer; what would you say the first step is?</b>

A: <i>Do stuff you're excited about and contribute to open source projects :-D</i>

Q: <b>How old are you and how much experience do you have as a programmer?</b>

A: <i>I am 30 years old, and very much :o</i>

Q: <b>How did you join Exponent? What was the cause?</b>

A: <i>James (ide) and I were the most active contributors to react-native outside of facebook and so we spoke a lot. He created exponent with Charlie.
      I ended up doing some consulting work with them and Charlie asked if I'd be interested in working with them full time and yea, it was lots of fun so I joined.</i>
      
Q: <b>I should know objective C and Java thoroughly before I jump in to React Native, right?</b>

A: <i>You can learn it as you go if you need to. there's also tons of pure javascript stuff that needs to be done. and documentation. lots of things :)</i>

<a name="charlie"></a>
###Charlie Cheever
<small>Charlie Cheever is the co-founder of Quora, an online knowledge market. He was formerly an engineer and manager at Facebook, where he oversaw the creation of Facebook Connect and the Facebook Platform. Prior to Facebook, Cheever was employed by Amazon.com in Seattle. He left Facebook to start Quora in June 2009 to work on Exponent.

https://github.com/ccheever</small>

Q: <b>What's the motivation of Exponent being free and Open Source?</b>

A: <i>I really want to make something that like a 12 year old version of me would use. So, someone who doesn't know tons about programming but can learn new things and doesn't have a credit card or lots of money, but has time and creativity and a phone and friends.
I learned to program making calculator games on TI-85, it's sad to me that kids cant make stuff on their phones today.</i>

Q: <b>Why did you leave Quora?</b>

A: <i>I managed the mobile teams there and it was so slow to work on those apps even tho we had good people, I found it so frustrating
      And after I left I tried to build some mobile stuff and it was so annoying that I decided there needed to be a different way to make stuff.
      So James and I made something like react Native called Ion. It was strikingly similar actually. But React Native already had android support and 20 people working on it, and we had 2 people.
      So we decided to make everything else around it that we wanted to make!</i>
      
Q: <b>What did you do at Facebook?</b>
      
A: <i>
I made the developer platform that all those games like FarmVille were on. Well not all of it obviously but was one of two main developers. And I worked on the first version of facebook video, then did a lot of random other things. Then was a manager and did login with Facebook on other sites, and then left to do Quora.

<a name="christopher"></a>
###Christopher Chedeau
<small>Christopher has been working at Facebook as a Front-end Engineer for about 5 years. Previously, he worked at Curse Network.

https://github.com/vjeux</small>

Q: <b>What do you do at Facebook?</b>

A: <i>
I was on the photos team when I started, then I discovered React and started adopting and promoting it both internally and externally. I was there at the beginning of react native and pushed it through until 3 months ago.
I just recently switched to the Nuclide team. i'm still #3 contributor on React Native ðŸ˜›.
</i>

Q: <b>Do you have any prior work experience?</b>

A: <i>
I was working for Curse (doing website for blizzard games) during my college to pay for it. It was fun to see the company go from 5 people in a guild to a 100 people company.
</i>

Q: <b>What's your day to day like at Facebook? Current project you're working on?</b>

A: <i>
I'm currently working on the Nuclide team, Facebook's IDE built on-top of Atom. I would say my time is spend half coding, half cheerleading all the cool stuff people are doing inside of fb. 
</i>

Q: <b>How do you think one can become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
I think that there are multiple levels.

The first level is mastering all the concepts. For example yesterday I had to write a function that removes certain keys from a big nested object. Because I've done this task so many times in the past, I was able to implement it in one go without even thinking and it worked the first time.

For this one, exercises are really good. You want to code the same kind of things many many times to train your muscle memory.

The second level is how do you build things in a way that are not going to break in the future. Ideally, once you build something, you can move to the next thing and it'll keep working without you there. This is challenging when there's a ton of developers touching the codebase and product directions changing often.

Finally, the third level is how do you prevent whole class of problems from even existing in the first place. A good example is with manual dom mutations, it's very easy to trigger some code that interacts with a dom node that has been removed from the dom. React came in and made this problem go away. You have to go out of your way to do so, and even if you want to do those things, you have the tools to make it work: lifecycle events.
</i>                    

Q: <b>Is there something you wish you'd known or learned earlier as a programmer?</b>

A: <i>
Probably the most important thing is: tradeoffs, tradeoffs, tradeoffs. They are everywhere.

If you are working on some random throwaway feature that no one is going to use, who cares if the code is maintainable, you need it to work and now one mistake I see a lot is that people over-engineer the easy things but are not willing to make their architecture less clean from a CS perspective even though it actually provides the user experience you need.

At the end of the day, we write all this code for the users, we should first understand what the user experience should be and then do whatever it takes to get it. 
If the user just needs to display some content and needs to be able to edit it easily, just install wordpress, pick a good looking theme and call it a day

######Btw, pro-tip, if you want to be successful, always think about the value you are providing. If you are earning $100k a year, this means that the company should be making $200k because you're here

###Dan Horrigan
<small>Dan is a Senior Back-end developer @Futuri Media. He has 20 years of programming experience in many different languages. He's been contributing to React Native early/mid 2015.

http://dhorrigan.com/</small>

Q: <b>What's your background as a programmer?</b>

A: <i>
I started learning to programming (with QBasic) when I was 11, and was hooked.  I learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I learned a few languages like Visual Basic, and started to dabble with C and C++.  Then I found web development, and dove in head first. First, learning HTML and CSS, then adding simple CGI scripts written in Perl, and eventually Classic ASP.

My first paying project was when I was 14: A website for the company my dad worked for, with a customer portal to let them see their job progress. This was all in ASP.  After that I started learning PHP, and have been using that as my language of choice ever since. However, I picked up a lot of experience with other languages along the way: JS, Python, Ruby (before Rails), Java, C#, Go, Objective-C.
</i>

Q: <b>What are some projects you're currently working on?</b>

A: <i>
I work for Futuri Media (http://futurimedia.com). We provide SaaS solutions for Broadcast Radio and TV companies. We provide white label mobile applications, social engagement and discovery, audio streaming and podcast solutions, etc. I haven't had much free time lately to contribute to many OSS projects, but hope to change that soon!

Currently I am a Senior Back-End Web Developer, but I am transitioning into being the Director of Technical Operations.
</i>
      
Q: <b>Is there something you wish you'd learned or knew earlier as a developer?</b>
      
A: <i>I wished I would have realized earlier in my career that it is OK to be wrong, and that failure is just a chance to learn.</i>
                                                                                                                                                  
Q: <b>What's the first step to becoming a good developer?</b>

A: <i>
Come up with a small-ish project that you think would be cool, or would make your life easier, and just jump right in.  Too many people try to learn without a goal other than "I want to learn to code." Without a goal, you are just reading docs or copy/pasting from tutorials...you can't learn that way.

To become a better developer, you need to do one simple thing: Never. Stop. Learning.  Read other people's code, figure out how that one app does that really cool thing you saw, read blogs, etc. No matter how good you are, or think you are, there is always someone better, and always more to learn.
</i>

Q: <b>Is there a certain project you're currently interested in? Next on your learning list?</b>

A: <i>
I have been using, and occasionally contributing to, React Native since early/mid 2015, and continue to be interested in it.

Next on my learning list is learning Erlang/Elixir. We build heavily distributed systems where I work, and think we would really benefit from a language like that.

###Janic Duplessis

<small>Janic is the co-founder of App & Flow, a react-native contributor and open-source contributor.

https://github.com/janicduplessis</small>

Q: <b>Any tips to becoming a better developer?</b>

A: <i>Don't think there's anything in particular, you just have keep learning and getting out of your comfort zone.
Like trying a new language or framework from time to time. At least that's what I do but I'm pretty sure there are some other good ways haha :-)</i>

Q: <b>How can I start contributing to React Native?</b>

A: <i>The best is to start with something small like a bug fix or adding a small feature like an extra prop on a component. 
Most contributors know either iOS or Android and a bit of JS. There are also some JS devs that work on things like the packager and cli.
We keep some issues with a Good First Task label that should be a good place to start</i>

###Jake Murzy

<small>Jake is an Open-source Archaeologist. He writes buzzword compliant code. Co-founder at @commitocracy. 

https://github.com/jmurzy</small>

Q: <b>Hey Jake, any tips to becoming a better programmer? :-)</b>

A: <i>Number one thing you should do is to learn your tools before you learn the language you work in, because it will lead to faster feedback loops and you will get to experience more in less time. So install a linter and it will catch most of your errors as you type.
It statically analyzes your code and recommends best practices to follow. You should always follow best practices until you gain enough experience to start questioning them.</i>

###Jun Ho Hwang

<small>Jun is a software engineer at Coupang, which is <i>the $5 Billion Startup Filling Amazon's Void In South Korea</i>. He is a very friendly developer who loves to connect. 

https://tocology.github.io </small>

Q: <b>How do you become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
The word 'better' can be described in various ways--especially in the field of programming. A good developer could be someone who is exceptionally talented in development, someone who is amazing at communicating, or someone who understands Business very well. I peronsally think a "good" developer is someone who is in the middle--a person who can solve his or her business problem with their development skills, and communicate with others about the issue. Ultimately, to achieve this, it requires lot of practice, and I recommend you to create your own service. Looking and thinking from the perspective of the user and improving the service to fulfill their needs really helps you grow as a better developer.
</i>

Q: <b>Is there something you wish you'd known or learned earlier as a developer?</b>

A: <i>
I really wish I started my own service earlier on. The hardest thing to grasp before developing is realizing how you can apply what you learned. Many developers are afraid to start a "service" because it sounds difficult; however, pondering about what to make and where to start, and then connecting those points of thought help you grow as a better developer.
</i>

Q: <b>What do you do at Coupang? What are you currently working on?</b>

A: <i>
Coupang provides a rocket-delivery-service, and I am working on developing a system called "Coupang Car," which is related to insurance and monetary management. Furthermore, I'm thinking about adding transporation control system and the ability to analyze data from the log.

<a name="keon"></a>
###Keon Kim
<small>Keon is a student at NYU who is really passionate about Machine Learning. He is a very active GitHub member who tries to contribute to open source projects related to machine learning.
                
https://github.com/keonkim</small>

Q: <b>What are your interests? What kind of projects have you worked on?</b>

A: <i>
I've been working on machine learning projects these days. I am one of the project members of DeepCoding Project, a project with a goal of translating written English to source code. I've been contributing to a C++ machine learning framework called mlpack(https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack), which is equivalent to scikit-learn in Python. 

I've also done some fun side projects: DeepStock (https://github.com/keonkim/deepstock) project is an attempt to predict the stock market trends by analyzing daily news headlines. CodeGAN (https://github.com/keonkim/CodeGAN) is a source code generator that uses one of the new deep learning methods called SeqGAN.
</i>

Q: <b> How do you become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
I think it is really important to understand the basics.
By basics I mean math, data structures and algorithms. 
Deep learning is really hot right now, and I see people jumping into learning it without basic knowledge in computer science and mathematics.
And of course most of them give up as soon as mathematical notations appear in the tutorial.
I know this because I was one of them and it took me really long time to understand some concepts that students with a strong fundamentals could understand in a fraction of the time I spent.
New languages, libraries, and frameworks are introduced iterally every day these days, and you need the fundamentals in order to keep up with them.

###Munseok Oh
<small>Munseok is a Full-stack developer and CTO at Sketchware. He previously worked at System Integration for ~7 years.  
                
https://sketchware.io</small>

Q: <b>How do I become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
When I was very young and cocky, I evaluated other developers based on their coding style. There were certain criterias they had to pass in order for me to judge them as a good developer. But now, I really don't think that way. Now, I believe that every developer is progressive, which means he or she is becoming a better developer every day. It doesn't really matter if the style is bad or code is good--as logn as the program runs, I think it's great! Whether the program has room for growth or has bugs, I think the motivation to develop is what really matters. Developers usually are never satisfied with their skills. They are always eager to become better--probably why you're doing this. It's really hard to justify "good developer". People like you will become better than me in no time. I still don't think I am a good developer.
</i>

Q: <b>What was the most difficult thing when you were developing Sketchware?</b>

A: <i>
Developing Sketchware wasn't too difficult, because we had a good blueprint for the item. The direction was very clear for us to follow, so developing it was a breeze. However, there was a line we had to maintain for Sketchware--this line had two conditions:

1. Sketchware must be an easy tool for anyone to create applications.
2. Whatever the user takes away from Sketchware can be applied in their future career

Since we wanted Sketchware to be an efficient tool that can help users learn programming concepts, I am very considerate and think a lot when it comes to adding new features in the application.
</i>

Q: <b>As a developer, is there something you wish you knew or fixed earlier?</b>

A: <i>
I really wish I jumped into the Start-up world earlier. When it comes to developing, you need to be passionate and really enjoy what you do. Even if you pull 3 all-nighters, ponder all day long about a new algorithm, or stress about a new bug, everything will be okay if you're enjoying it. 
It really goes back to the question #1--I get my energy from the joy I have when I develop, and that joy eventually makes you a better developer. When life hits you, most developers lose the passion to develop if you think of it as work. I used to be like that.
But now, I'm really not worried--since developing brings joy to me now. Even if we run out of funds or our company burns down, it's really okay since I am making the most out of what I am doing.

###Satyajit Sahoo

<small>Satyajit is the UX Lead at Glucosio, and Front-end Engineer at Callstack.io. He is an amazing open-source contributor; he is one of the top 5 contributors in React Native 

https://github.com/satya164</small>

Q: <b>What is your background as a programmer?</b>

A: <i>
I don't really come from a programming background. I did my graduation in Forestry. I left post-graduation after getting a job offer and never looked back.</i>
 
Q: <b>What's your day like on day to day basis?</b>

A: <i>It's pretty boring. I wake up, order some breakfast online or go out, then start office work. In evening I go out to a bar or take a long walk if there's enough time left. At night I mostly watch TV series or hack on side-projects.</i>

Q: <b>Motivation behind contributing to open source projects?</b>

A: <i>
I've been involved in Open Source for a long time. When I was doing my graduation I got into Linux and got introduced to the world of Open Source. I loved it how we could learn so much from other projects. It fascinated me that developers were selfless to let us see and use there code for free (mostly). I did a lot of Open Source projects in form of themes and apps during my college days, and it always made me happy when people forked them and changed to meet their needs, and send pull requests to fix things.

As a developer, I contribute to Open Source projects most of the time because I need a feature, or it improves something in a project I love. I think it's better if we work together to fix stuff that are important to us rather than just filing issues.
</i>

Q: <b>How do I become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
I think it's important that we are open to new things. There's a lot to learn, and we cannot learn if we stay in our bubble. Try new things, even if you think you can't do it, even it looks complex on the surface. I have failed to do things so many times, but eventually succeed. In the process I understand the problem and the solution, and then it becomes really simple.

###Sonny Lazuardi Hermawan

<small>Sonny is a JavaScript Full Stack Engineer, a React & React Native player, and an Open source enthusiast. He currently works as an Engineer at Sale Stock.

https://github.com/sonnylazuardi</small>

Q: <b>How do you become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
I think always eager to learn is the key. Try everything, make mistakes, and learn from that mistakes. I agree that code review from partners and senior engineers will make our code better.
Try publishing your own open source projects, meet other great developers and learn from them.
</i>

Q: <b>What's your motivation behind creating open source projects?</b>

A: <i>
I just want the people know about our idea, and try implementing it so that others can use our project. I'm really inspired by people that work on open source projects that used by many devs such as Dan Abramov that created redux.

###Sunggu Hwang

<small>Sunggu worked at Daum Communications for 4 years. Then, he left Daum to work at Scatter Lab as the CTO. This is his 5th year at Scatter Lab. 

https://scatterlab.co.kr</small>

Q: <b>How do you become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>Hmm... Becoming a good developer... Every developer has his or her own personality when it comes to programming.
As an analogy, think about blacksmiths! Not all blacksmiths are alike--some enjoy crafting the best sword, while some might enjoy testing out the sword more than crafting it.
I am a thinker--who plans and organizes thoughts before I carry out an action. I think a good developer knows how to write concise and clean code; you should practice this habit.
Even though the trend for programming is always changing, and many people use different languages, write a piece of code that anyone can understand without comments.</i>
 
Q: <b>What do you think is the next BIG thing? </b>

A: <i>I've observed the evolution of programming languages, and I think it's becoming more abstract every generation--procedural programming, imperative programming, functional programming...
I think in the future, maybe in about 20 to 30 years, we will live in the time where the computer writes the code for us, and we just put them together like legos.</i>

Q: <b>What should I focus on studying?</b>

A: <i>I think deep learning is a must. Try different tutorials and learn it with passion. Math, algorithms--anything will help you in the long run.</i>

###Timothy Ko

<small>Timothy is a software engineer at Snapchat. He previously worked at many places such as Riot Games, Square, etc. 

https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-ko-33127159</small>

Q: <b>What do you do at Snapchat?</b>

A: <i>I'm a software engineer on the monetization team, so I work on anything related to making money.
Some example projects are: Snapchat Discover, a news platform within the iOS and Android apps; Ad Manager, a control panel used by sales and ad operations to flight ads; Ads API, which allows third party partners to integrate their own ad platforms into Snapchat.
Also, I was a past intern at Snapchat so I occasionally give talks and Q&As to upcoming interns. I'm also heavily invested in hiring and conduct a lot of interviews there.</i>

 
Q: <b>What do you do on day-to-day basis?</b>

A: <i>What I've mentioned previously. Also, even after I pass on the work to other people, sometimes I have to go back and help support it or be part of the technical discussions on future changes.
When new people join the team, usually I'm the one to ramp people up on how the code base looks like, the kinds of frameworks we use, how a typical engineer workflow looks like, etc.
</i>

Q: <b>What languages / framework do you guys mostly use?</b>

A: <i>
For server code, it's usually Java and for UI we use React Redux.
Most teams work in google appengine, which is why we use Java, but some teams switch it up a little bit due to some appengine limitations.
And of course, the product teams work in objective C for iOS and Java for Android.
</i>

Q: <b>How do you think I can become a better developer?</b>

A: <i>
I think the best thing to do is to do as many things as possible.
I did seven internships while in school so I already had two years of work experience before I graduated.
Work experience is super important because coding in a hackathon, doing personal projects, and doing school assignments are totally different than working with enterprise software and apps with real users.
But you have to start somewhere, so that's where going to school, doing personal projects, and competing in hackathons comes in.
And while at work, i think the best way to succeed is to ask lots of questions and learn by doing.
You can read and study all you want, but you might not understand what's going on until you actually do it.
Another thing is code reviews -- you can do so much knowledge transfer by having a more senior engineer tear your code apart and tell you how to make it better.
Also, if you ever come up with a proposal on how to solve a problem, getting a tech lead to bombard you with hard questions forces you to make sure you have every little detail covered.
